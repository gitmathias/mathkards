# mathkards-api

There is a likely-trademarked card game that we are rebuilding in code so we don't have to pay $17 for a paper deck.

# Technology

This project is assumed to the the RESTful API that will power a native mobile app or perhaps a web front-end. To keep with the spirit of the collaborators, we're trying something different for the team and went with node.js using very basic parts of express. It's our first attempt so we don't expect to be inspirational. We just want to have fun with coworkers and also improve our basic math skillz.

We would like to demonstrate good scope management and integrate some sort of JS testing for all the services. There will eventually be a persistence layer to manage the game flow.
